The repository represents the outcome of Duke University's Data+ Summer Research Program's project entitled: "Quantifying the Burden of Rare Diseases in the Duke Health System"

# Participants and the Program
The faculty client of this project was Rachel Richesson MS, PhD, MPH, FACMI from the Duke School of Nursing. The project manager was Isaac Lavine, current PhD Student at Duke University. The student researchers were Gary Koplik, current graduate student at Duke, and Matthew Tribby, currently an undergraduate majoring in computer science at Duke.

This was the result of a teen week research program through Data+ in the summer of 2016-2017. 

# Goal of the Project
Worked to leverage electronic medical record (EMR) data to quantify the number of rare diseases treated at Duke University Health System (DUHS) and to estimate the number and characteristics of patients affected by these conditions. 

The goal of uploading this to Github is in hopes of encouraging most discussion of this issue and providing an open-source access to our code to allow for replication in different medical systems. 

# Outcome of Project
The main takeaway from this project was the hinderance on research due to the lack of specificity of ICD coding terminology.
A summary of the results and methods used will be posted on this repository in the form of a formal paper coming soon. 

# Contents of Repo
There are three major folders in this repository:
1. Scripts: The R scripts that were implemented to allow for analysis on Duke medical data.
2. Analysis: The summarized results of the analysis that was done on the data.
3. Figures: Visuals that were used throughout the program in either of our two presentations or our final poster.
